# Covid-hospital-management

Looking at the deadly 2nd wave in India, I came with the idea of making hospital management system. Here I am taking a hospital and managing the records of the patient in that hospital. As the number of corona cases increases, it becomes more difficult to search for bed and oxygen availability, so, here I assumed myself as a receptionalist and if any patient is coming to me for query, then I would be able to answer the query of current status of hospital.
